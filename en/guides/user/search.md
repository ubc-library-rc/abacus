### Search syntax tips

_This section can be included under "Search" in the main user guide page, or could exist as its own page (not sure yet which is best). The "Search" section of the main guide can also change._

Where possible, illustrate with examples from Abacus. The Statistics Canada datasets may be a good place to start: a search for Canada Census produces way too many results, but the tips in this section can help users be more sepecific. The "General Social Survey" is another set that could be used in examples.
Some content to include: 

- Explain that search terms are connected with OR by default, show how to connect with AND
- Add sections like these from https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/the-standard-query-parser.html
  - Wilcard searches
  - Specifying fields in a query
  - Boolean operators
  - Grouping terms to form subqueries
  - **maybe?** searching for date ranges (with simplified examples like `* to NOW`

This [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) may help with formatting content. 
Soon after making a change in Git, the output will be visible at https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/abacus/en/guides/user/search.html
